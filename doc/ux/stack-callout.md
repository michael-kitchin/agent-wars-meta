# Stack Callout

The list of units in one hex.

## Purpose

Let the player see a stack, or a lone enemy unit, and change which human units in that hex are selected.

## Availability

Opens in Strategic planning and Tactical planning after a click on a stack or a lone enemy icon, once a short delay elapses. It does not open while a hover order preview is active, while strategic units are hidden because the map is zoomed to battle detail, or during Resolution playback. The current code can open it during playback; see Known Deviations in [resolution-playback.md](resolution-playback.md). It closes when the player dismisses it, presses Escape, clicks outside it, or starts a gesture that hides it. See [input-map.md](input-map.md) and [selection-model.md](selection-model.md).

## Information Displayed

- One row per unit in the hex, sorted by side, type, and name. Each row shows the unit name.
- Human rows include a toggle that shows whether that unit is in the selection.
- When the hex has human units and Shift is not held, a "+ All" control selects the selectable human units.
- When Shift is held and the hex has human units, "+ All" adds them and "- All" removes them.
- A close control.
- A sealift section when the hex has a sealift action. See [order-lifecycle.md](order-lifecycle.md).

Enemy rows have no selection toggle.

## Inputs and Responses

### Mouse

- When the player clicks a human row's toggle, that unit is added to or removed from the selection.
- When the player clicks "+ All" without Shift, the selectable human units in the hex become the selection.
- When Shift is held and the player clicks "+ All", those units are added. "- All" removes them.
- When the player clicks the close control, the callout closes.
- When the player presses outside the callout, it closes. A press on the same spot as the opening click is left for the double-click handler.

### Keyboard

- When the player presses Escape and the build popup is closed, the callout closes. A callout that is scheduled but not open yet is cancelled too. While the tactical battles list is open, Escape leaves the callout alone. See [input-map.md](input-map.md).

### Other

- Opening the callout closes the build popup and the hex tooltip.
- A double-click that plans an order cancels a scheduled callout. A double-click that does not plan an order still lets the scheduled callout open.

## States

- Scheduled: a click asked for the callout, and the delay has not elapsed.
- Open: the list is visible.
- Closed: hidden. This is the start state.

## Invariants

- Enemy units in the callout never become selected.
- Select-all and add-all both read "+ All". They are never shown at the same time: Shift decides which one is showing.
- The callout never opens during a hover order preview.
- Embarked land units stay unselectable from the callout, the same as from the map.

## Strategic and Tactical Differences

The rows, All controls, and toggles work the same in both theaters. In Tactical planning the callout lists battle units. A sealift section can appear in either theater when that hex has sealift capacity. Changing a slot applies immediately in both theaters. In Tactical planning that change also drops pending marches for the units involved. At battle-detail zoom on the strategic map, the callout does not open.
