# UX Specification

This suite states the functional UX requirements of the Agent Wars desktop UI for people and coding agents changing it.

Each document's Code Entry Points name paths under `src/` and `static/` for traceability; they are not in this companion.

## Authority

This suite is normative for the user-visible behavior of the Agent Wars desktop UI: what each element shows, which inputs it accepts, and how it responds. When renderer code disagrees with a requirement here, the disagreement is either a bug in the code or an intended behavior change. Either way, the change that alters behavior must also update the affected document. Each document's Known Deviations section lists disagreements that are already known and accepted as bugs; check it before "fixing" code to match the spec.

Game mechanics (numbers, legality rules, resolution order, caps) are not defined here. They are governed by the mechanics documents listed in [README.md](README.md), where the engine remains the first authority. UX documents link to those documents instead of restating them.

Visual styling and the arrangement of items inside an element are out of scope. See [ui-style-guide.md](ui-style-guide.md).

## How to Use This Suite

1. Find the element you're changing in the routing table below.
2. Read the cross-cutting documents it lists, then the element document.
3. Check Known Deviations before treating a spec and code mismatch as a bug.
4. If your change alters user-visible behavior, update the requirement text in the same change.
5. If the spec is silent or ambiguous, add an Open Question rather than inventing a requirement.

## Document Structure

Element documents share a fixed heading set:

- Purpose
- Availability
- Information Displayed
- Inputs and Responses
- States
- Invariants
- Strategic and Tactical Differences
- Related Documents
- Known Deviations
- Open Questions
- Code Entry Points

## Cross-Cutting Documents

- [modes-and-transitions.md](ux/modes-and-transitions.md): application modes, what triggers each transition, and what state carries across.
- [selection-model.md](ux/selection-model.md): how units and hexes become selected, and what clears or keeps a selection.
- [input-map.md](ux/input-map.md): every global mouse and keyboard binding, and precedence between them.
- [order-lifecycle.md](ux/order-lifecycle.md): how orders go from draft to preview, commit, and resolution, and the feedback at each step.
- [notifications-and-feedback.md](ux/notifications-and-feedback.md): which surface reports which kind of message, plus the map toasts.

## Glossary

- Hex: one cell of the world or battle grid.
- Stack: two or more units in the same hex, or the callout that lists them.
- Selection: the human units the player has chosen. The selected hex is tracked separately.
- Targeting mode: Ranged or Strike, while the next map click chooses a target.
- Order: a march, ferry, ranged attack, air strike, or build queue entry. Sealift embark and debark apply immediately and are not orders in this sense.
- Draft order: an order that is queued and not yet resolved.
- Pending order: a draft order shown in a right-panel list.
- Theater: strategic play on the world map, or tactical play inside a battle.
- Contested hex: a strategic hex with units from both sides, eligible for a tactical battle.
- Fog of war: hidden information the player has not yet earned. The rules are in the combat rules.

## Element and Mode Matrix

Cells are `Shown`, `Hidden`, `Disabled` (visible, but pointer input is off), `Changed` (the document spells out which), or `n/a`. Resolution playback can be strategic or tactical. A `Changed` cell in that column means the document distinguishes those two.

## Open Questions by Document

None.

## Known Deviations by Document

Each entry is a requirement that the renderer does not meet yet. Cross-cutting documents link to the element document that holds the entry.
