# Releasing

How a version of Agent Wars becomes a GitHub release. The builds are unsigned side-load builds for Windows (x64), macOS (Apple silicon), and Linux (x64), made by the Build workflow in `.github/workflows/build.yml` in the private game tree. That workflow is not published here.

## Before the build

1. **Set the version.** `npm version <x.y.z> --no-git-tag-version` updates `package.json` and `package-lock.json`. The version names the archives, the Windows and macOS executables (`Agent Wars v<x.y.z>`), and the release tag (`v<x.y.z>`).
2. **Write the release notes** at `doc/release-notes/v<x.y.z>.md`. The draft-release job fails without them. Start from the previous version's notes: downloads, first-launch steps, what's new, and known limits.
3. **Update the version where the docs state it.** In the root README of the private game tree: the executable names under Play it, the version under Status, and the test count under What's inside. That README is not published here. In [doc/README.md](README.md): the shipping version.
4. **Check the third-party notices.** New dependencies or data need entries in `THIRD-PARTY-NOTICES.md` at the root of the private game tree. That file is not published here. `npm run test` ends with the notices check.
5. **Run `npm run test`**, then commit and push to `main`. The CI workflow runs the same check on the push.

## Build and draft the release

1. Start the Build workflow on `main` with **Create a draft release from this commit** checked: in GitHub under **Actions > Build > Run workflow**, or with `gh workflow run build.yml --ref main -f draft_release=true`.
2. Each OS job tests, packages, and archives its build. The macOS job keeps electron-builder's signature when it verifies and signs ad hoc when it doesn't, since Apple silicon won't launch an app without a valid signature.
3. The release job runs only when all three builds pass. It writes `SHA256SUMS.txt` for the archives and creates a draft release `v<x.y.z>` on the built commit, with the notes file as its body.

If a build fails, nothing is drafted: fix the problem, push, and run the workflow again. Delete an older draft for the same version before drafting a new one (`gh release delete v<x.y.z>`).

## Smoke test, then publish

A draft is visible only to people with write access to the repository. Before publishing it, download each archive you can test from the draft and, for each one:

1. Check the archive against `SHA256SUMS.txt`.
2. Extract it and launch the game through the operating system's first-launch warning, as the notes describe.
3. Start a match, save an OpenRouter key, run one consultation, and resolve one turn.

On macOS, a message that the app "is damaged" means its signature didn't survive packaging. Don't publish that build; start with the signature step in `build.yml`.

Then review the notes and the asset list on the draft and choose **Publish release** (or run `gh release edit v<x.y.z> --draft=false`). Publishing creates the tag `v<x.y.z>` on the built commit, and the Release badge in the README picks up the new version.

## Builds without a release

Run the Build workflow with the box unchecked. Each run keeps one archive per OS as a workflow artifact until the repository's artifact retention period ends. `gh run download <run-id>` fetches them.

Hand out those archives as they are. Don't re-zip the unpacked folders by hand: an archive made on Windows drops the Unix permissions the Linux launcher needs, and a macOS app bundle needs its symlinks kept. That's why each OS job archives its own build.
