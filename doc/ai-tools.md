# AI tools (engine)

What the opponent model can **call**, plus host-only helpers that share the same executors. Prompt wording for those tools is in [ai-commander-prompts/](ai-commander-prompts/README.md). Groups are `TOOL_GROUP_REGISTRY` in `src/main/openRouter/openRouterToolGroups.ts`.

The engine under `src/` wins if this file drifts. Those paths are named for traceability; they are not in this companion.

## Groups shown to the model

| Group id | Tools on the model | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `planning` | `plan_route`, `check_distance` | `PATHFINDING_TOOL_NAMES` |
| `assessment` | `assess_unit`, `assess_hex` | `ASSESSMENT_TOOL_NAMES`. Omitted from a strategic consult tool list when a precomputed briefing is present (`requestOrdersFlow` excludes them). In battle, `assess_unit` stays when the group is on and `assess_hex` is stripped (`filterToolNamesForTacticalBattle`). |
| `estimation` | `estimate_combat` | `COMBAT_ESTIMATION_TOOL_NAMES`. Same strategic omission when a briefing is present. Offered in battle when the group is on. |
| `memory` | `memory_read` | `MEMORY_TOOL_NAMES`. Writes are `memoryUpdates` in the envelope, not tools. |
| `orders` | `query_orders` | `STANDING_ORDER_TOOL_NAMES`. Assign/cancel are envelope actions; `executeStandingOrderActionForPlayer` still implements `assign_order` / `cancel_order` for the host and for parsed JSON. |
| `production` | `query_production`, `set_build_queue` | `PRODUCTION_TOOL_NAMES`. Strategic only. `set_build_queue` is a **write** tool; queues can also arrive as `productionOrders` in the envelope. |
| `precomputation` | *(none)* | UI group; the pipeline is `precomputation.ts`, not a model-callable tool. |

Disabled groups drop those tools from the numbered list and omit the matching briefing/envelope tails (see `variants.md` in the prompt package). A model whose OpenRouter listing does not include `tools` is consulted with every model-callable group off, whatever the Tools tab says; the strategic briefing is still attached, and the Tools tab's Events group still applies (`variants.md` section 2.6).

## Pathfinding

`src/main/tools/pathfinding.ts` (tactical: `tacticalPathfinding.ts`).

- **`plan_route`:** Multi-turn path for a unit toward a destination hex code (or a land target that naval must approach via water/coastal). Returns a hex-code path, remaining turns, and optional suggested destinations. Naval land-target handling redirects to the nearest water/coastal hex.
- **`check_distance`:** Grid/path distance and estimated turns between two hex codes.

Strategic movement budgets are `getMovementBudget` (infantry 1, armor 2, naval 2, air 0). Armor that enters a rugged, arctic, or city hex ends its move there and may leave if it starts there. A longer route continues on the next turn, and `plan_route` and `check_distance` include that halt in the turn count. With the weather bonus on, `plan_route` and `check_distance` estimate the whole route with the budget of the hex the unit occupies now. `check_distance` names no unit, so it uses the weather tags of the AI's own unit of that type on the start hex or cell, or any player's unit of that type when the AI has none there, and treats an empty start as untagged. Tactical marches use terrain-weighted MP (`tacticalRanges.ts` + `tacticalTerrainCombatModifiers.ts`), including the weather budget and open-ground cost from [combat rules §4.9](combat-rules-v3.md).

## Assessment

`src/main/tools/assessment.ts`.

- **`assess_unit`:** Nearby enemies/friendlies, threat severity, standing-order status, `canAttackThisTurn`. Distances are hop counts when fog is off on the strategic map (`usesOmniscientGridProximity`); fog-on uses path lengths when a path exists.
- **`assess_unit` in battle** (`tacticalAssessUnit.ts`): the sub-unit's terrain, `movementPointsThisBeat`, and `rangedRangeThisBeat`; per nearby enemy, `inRangedRange` / `inEnemyRangedRange` under battle range, terrain, and line-of-sight rules (air needs an intact airport), `canEnterCellThisBeat`, and `estimatedBeatsToReach` / `estimatedBeatsToReachYou` from the battle march planner (`tacticalMarchEstimate.ts`); threats and `canAttackThisBeat`. `radius` counts battle cells (default 4). Distances are battle-cell hops. Cargo shares its carrier's cell, cannot march, and when embarked at sea neither fires nor is a ranged target. Air sub-units do not march, so their beats-to-reach fields are null. A `canAttackThisBeat` row with no attack names the rule that blocks it: no intact airport for air, cargo embarked at sea on either side, or distance against battle range.
- **`assess_hex`:** Terrain, passability, occupants, notes. Pre-computation runs this on human-occupied (and other relevant) hexes for Supplemental Hex Intelligence. Not available in battle: a call that reaches the engine returns an error. With the weather bonus on, the result includes `weather` for that hex.
- **Weather fields** (rules in [combat rules §4.9](combat-rules-v3.md)): present only while the weather bonus is on. Strategic and battle `assess_unit` add `weatherTags`, `weatherHere`, `rangedAttackPenalized`, and `airStrikePenalizedAtBase`. The two penalized flags are true for any penalty, at Low or High. A unit with no tags has `weatherTags: []`. `weatherHere` is the weather of the hex or battle. An unexplored hex reports `weather: null` on `assess_hex`. The assessed unit's movement budget, and each nearby unit's turn estimate, uses the weather of the hex that mover occupies. In battle, `movementPointsThisBeat` already includes the weather budget. `estimate_combat` uses the same ranged and air-strike thresholds as resolution and does not change melee.
- **Origin bonus fields** (`originBonusAssessment.ts`; rules in [combat rules §4.9](combat-rules-v3.md)): present only while a flag that applies in the mode is on, so with both flags off results are unchanged. The `assess_unit` unit block gains `originBonusHere` (`[]`, `['origin']`, `['terrain']`, or both) when the origin bonus is on, or in battle when either flag is on, with `originBonusAmount` beside it (0 when the list is empty, otherwise the 2 or 4 that unit adds where it stands); `birthOrigin` (the same place label as the unit tooltip: the country once, or the brief name and country for a subdivision; not the hex place id) when the origin bonus is on; and in battle `birthTerrain` when the terrain bonus is on. `assess_hex` gains `origin` (the place id: the majority country name on the global map, or the origin-unit id on a regional map, or null) when the origin bonus is on. Stacked units each get their own values.
- **Tech bonus fields** (rules in [combat rules §4.9](combat-rules-v3.md)): present only while the tech bonus is on. `assess_unit` adds `techLevel` of `basic` or `advanced`, from the generated urban count of the birth hex (21 or more is Advanced). Stacked battle units each get their own tier.

## Combat estimation

`src/main/tools/combatEstimation.ts`.

- **`estimate_combat`:** Analytical hit probabilities (Poisson-binomial over A&A d20 rolls) for a proposed matchup. Return fire uses planning-parity eligibility. Ad-hoc when the model still has the tool; the briefing no longer dumps a full estimate table.
- **Arguments** (`normalizeCombatSideArgs` in `combatEstimationSides.ts`): `attackers` and the optional `defenders` each take real `units` ids or hypothetical `assumed` `{ type, count }` entries, and non-empty `units` wins. Non-string ids and `assumed` entries without a string `type` and a finite `count` are ignored; counts round down, never go below zero, and may arrive as numeric strings. `attackers` must keep at least one id or entry.
- **Sides:** real ranged attackers that cannot reach the target are dropped with a warning, and the call fails when none can. Assumed attackers stand on the target cell, so ranged return fire is not evaluated for them (a warning says so). Without `defenders`, every non-AI unit on the target cell defends; units there that sit out the engagement (such as cargo embarked at sea) are named in a warning, and an empty cell yields an `uncontested` prediction.
- **Melee roles:** melee resolution picks at random which side rolls attack values and which rolls defense values, so melee predictions average both cases and report each in `meleeRoleOutcomes` (`attackersRollAttack`, `attackersRollDefense`).
- **Origin bonus and terrain bonus:** summary `attackValue` and `defenseValue` are the effective values, including the origin bonus, and every hit probability uses them. A row whose unit qualifies adds `originBonus: 2` (Low) or `originBonus: 4` (High), the amount actually added. Real ranged attackers are judged where they stand, real melee attackers and all defenders at the target. Assumed units never qualify.
- **Tech bonus:** the same effective values also include tech. A real Advanced unit adds `techBonus: { attack: 2, defense: 0 }` at Low, or `{ attack: 2, defense: 2 }` at High. Defense is present and 0 at Low. The field is omitted when both points are 0. Assumed units never qualify. The tier follows the birth hex, not the hex where the unit would roll.
- **Terrain cover:** for ranged estimates, each attacker's `attackValue` already subtracts the target's cover against that attacker ([combat rules §4.9](combat-rules-v3.md), "Terrain cover"): the target hex's main terrain on the strategic map, the target cell's terrain and urban or rubble flags in a battle. Melee and return fire never take cover. Return fire does take the weather penalty, as in resolution. The result has no separate cover field.
- **Theaters** (`combatEstimationTheater.ts`): strategic estimates leave land units embarked at sea out of ranged and melee, like strategic resolution. Battle estimates use battle range, terrain, and line-of-sight rules and the battle return-fire context (`tacticalCombatInput.ts`), place cargo on its carrier's cell, leave cargo embarked at sea out of ranged combat only, and reject air attackers because battle air strikes use different dice.

## Memory

`src/main/tools/memory.ts`.

- **`memory_read`:** Fetch stored-tier notes by key or tag.
- Limits: **5** persistent slots (`PERSISTENT_LIMIT`), **15** stored (`STORED_LIMIT`). Persistent rows appear in every strategic briefing. There are no `memory_write` / `memory_delete` tools on the model.

## Standing orders

`src/main/tools/standingOrders.ts` + `standingOrdersCore.ts` (the status block injected into the briefing is in `standingOrdersInjectionText.ts`).

- **Model tool:** `query_orders` only.
- **Order types:** `defend`, `march`, `pursue`, `patrol`, `hold_fire`. Air cannot take `march`, `pursue`, or `patrol` (`AIR_INELIGIBLE_ORDER_TYPES`).
- **`hold_fire`:** Suppresses DEFEND auto-engagement and the tempo sweep for that unit until replaced.
- Standing orders do **not** move tactical sub-units. They can still generate DEFEND fire from the parent.

## Production

`src/main/tools/productionTools.ts`. Strategic only.

- **`query_production`:** Controlled hexes, urban/airport/seaport counts, available types, queues. Capped types are hidden when another type can still spawn (`filterQueueableUnitTypes`); a hex whose every available type is maxed is marked `all at cap`.
- **`set_build_queue`:** Replaces that hex's queue with one type and count (`BUILD_ENTRY_MIN_COUNT`–`MAX`, 1..99). Rejects a capped type when an alternative exists (`shouldRejectCappedQueueType`).
- **While a tactical battle is open:** Opponent `set_build_queue` and `productionOrders` from a strategic consult apply when the turn phase is planning. The human build popup stays closed for that battle. See [build-popup.md](ux/build-popup.md).

Costs and prerequisites: [combat-rules-v3.md](combat-rules-v3.md) §2.

## Encoding

Arguments and results that carry geography are converted to briefing hex codes before the model sees them (`encodeOpenRouterToolResultForLlm`). Engine error strings (`status: error`) are passed through.
