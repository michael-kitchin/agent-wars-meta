&nbsp;

I need to ensure that by the time this code leaves my control I understand:

1\. What functionality is there, including the overall codebase and what’s been changed in the current branch

2\. Why that functionality is there and why those changes have been made

3\. Why those changes are the best choice for this client, project, and task

4\. Caveats, gotchas, or other obvious concerns or limitations that remain

Please review the .spec documents and codebase, then provide this information. Before you start, please ask any questions you need to in order to ensure reliable execution and reliable and high-quality results.

&nbsp;
\===

&nbsp;

Standard coding rules:

1\. Please ensure all generated code is reliable and easy to understand. Double-check if generating for the first time.

2\. Please ensure that all new and updated public backend method invocations generate debug-level log messages, all caught exceptions generate error-level log messages, and all getter-style methods that don't modify state generate trace-level messages. Ensure all new and updated log messages include a reasonable level of detail for troubleshooting, and use the existing logging APIs. Note that these logging APIs check log levels before building message strings, so it's unnecessary to check the log level beforehand unless potentially large strings are being constructed inline with the logging call itself.

3\. Please ensure that we're only testing happy paths and essential failure cases for all new and updated code. We want to test essential code contracts and not implementation details. We do not need to test REST controller methods that directly delegate to component calls, DTO constructors, accessors, or similar boilerplate. Please remove any test cases or classes made unnecessary by these restrictions.

4\. Please ensure all new and updated fields and non-overriding methods of all cardinalities (static/instance, outer/inner) and access levels (public, private, and package-private) have correctly formatted orienting comments. An orienting comment explains why a field or method exists and generally when to use it, how to use it, and what to expect in terms of results and exceptions. Comments for interface and abstract methods focus on code contracts, while those for implementation methods focus on high-level implementation details.

5\. Please ensure all spec, design, and similar guidance documents are written as markdown files to the .spec directory.

6\. Please look for, create, and evolve reusable code and other elements, to the extent this doesn't put reliability, performance, user experience, or other goals at significant risk.

7\. Use the most reasonable, up-to-date coding patterns for the chosen language level (examples: Java stream APIs instead of for-loops).&nbsp;

8\. Use boilerplate reduction techniques and related language features where reasonable (example: Lombok annotations and record classes in Java).

9\. The desirable size limit for all source files is 600 lines, and a hard limit is 1000\. When you reach these limits, move and/or decompose functionality to reasonably partitioned and organized sub-modules.&nbsp;

10\. The desirable limit of named method/function arguments is 6 and a hard limit is 10\. When you reach these limits, move and/or decompose functionality to reasonably partitioned and organized sub-methods/-functions. Parameter objects are an acceptable alternative, as long as they otherwise comply with my rules.

11\. Never commit or push changes under any circumstances. I intend to review all changes before sharing them with other developers.

12\. Identifiers used in phases, stages, hypotheses, or other divisions in plans, debugging workflows, or files in the .spec or .test folders should never be included in code, comments, configuration files, documentation, or anything else that is (or is likely to be) in version control.


13\. Classes, fields, variables, arguments, functions and other symbols should be marked according to their intended mutability or immutability, as appropriate for the chosen language level (examples: final in Java, const in TypeScript, and open in Kotlin).

14\. Follow `docs/naming-conventions-contract-v1.md`. Directories and TypeScript files under `src/` use camelCase. Exported functions are camelCase; exported types are PascalCase. Use only the allowed role suffixes (`Handler`, `Helpers`, `Guards`, `Adapter`, `Pipeline`, `Core`, `Types`). Do not use `Utils` or `Impl`. Do not put milestone or tool-group numbers in identifiers. Do not rename frozen string values (IPC channels, LLM tool names, SQL columns, vendor JSON fields). Do not put identifiers used to name plans, workflows, or spec phases into product code, comments, configuration, or lint messages.

&nbsp;
\===

&nbsp;

I intend to estimate \<capability\>.

&nbsp;

For this I need:

1\. A maximum of ten development task names that describe this. Task names should be simple, direct, and as imperative as possible (example: "spec writing for...", "codegen for...", "testgen for...", "add X to...", "update Y to...", "smoke test Z", "design A to...", "fix B to...", etc.), preferably no more than ten  words.&nbsp;

2\. We do not need task names for code review/verification, QA, or documentation (we have standard tasks for these).&nbsp;

3\. Group similar tasks as needed to meet the max task count goal.

4\. Minimize articles and connecting verbs to reduce wordcount.

5\. Abbreviate, substitute "&" for "and", " w/" for "with", and minimize technical specifics to reduce wordcount.

6\. No semicolon, emdash, emoji, or arrow use.

7\. Use only alphanumeric characters with standard punctuation.

&nbsp;

For each task generate the following three relative effort scores, starting with 1.0 (in other words: 2.0 is twice as much effort and 0.5 is half):

1\. Best Case:  Smallest reasonable effort, with actual work within estimates 25% of the time (i.e., a 1 in 4 chance of coming true).

2\. Worst Case: Largest reasonable effort, with actual work within estimates 75% of the time (i.e., a 3 in 4 chance of coming true).

3\. Most Likely: Most probable effort, using best judgment.

&nbsp;

Task names and BWL values should be listed in a preformatted markdown block on their own line and separated by tabs, to enable easy copying/pasting into a spreadsheet.

&nbsp;

Methodology notes:

A. We use an agentic development workflow, typically consisting of the following tasks: spec writing, code generation (codegen), test plan generation (testgen), and test plan execution and troubleshooting, all followed by hands-on verification and QA

B. Spec writing is commonly split by functional domain into overlapping documents, such as (for example) admin Ui and report import. We will work one task per document.

C. Codegen is rarely split into multiple tasks, except when necessary

D. Spec, codegen, and testgen work should be grouped by codebase proximity or other technical overlap into as few tasks as will be reasonable, for this style of development

&nbsp;

Before you get started, ask any questions you need to in order to ensure reliable and high-quality results.

&nbsp;
\===

&nbsp;

Ensure the task mix and estimates are complete, correct, consistent, addresses my stated needs, and will be clear and understandable for other estimators. Before you get started, ask any questions you need to in order to ensure reliable and high-quality results.

&nbsp;
\===

&nbsp;

Now generate acceptance criteria (AC) for this capability, as follows:

1\. No more than ten AC with no more than a dozen words each.

2\. AC are suitable for code reviewers, QA, and stakeholders during acceptance.&nbsp;

3\. AC are clear, concise, and provable.

4\. AC do not need to specify obvious invariants, such as "it should work", "it should work more than once", or "it doesn't break anything else", etc.

5\. Group similar AC as needed to meet the max task count goal.

6\. Minimize articles and connecting verbs to reduce wordcount.

7\. Abbreviate, substitute "&" for "and", " w/" for "with", and minimize technical specifics to reduce wordcount.

8\. No semicolon, emdash, emoji, or arrow use.

9\. Use only alphanumeric characters with standard punctuation.
